## Conversion Details

### General Changes Applied to All Components:

1. Replaced `setup()` with `data()`, `computed`, and `methods` options
2. Converted reactive references (`ref()` and `reactive()`) to properties in the `data()` function
3. Moved computed properties to the `computed` option
4. Transformed methods from within `setup()` to the `methods` option
5. Changed lifecycle hooks (`onMounted()` → `mounted()`, `onErrorCaptured` → `errorCaptured`)
6. Modified access patterns (using `this.` prefix instead of direct variable access)
7. Moved store instantiation from component setup to methods/computed properties
8. Updated ref access to use `this.$refs` pattern

### Bug Fixes Made During Conversion:

1. **AdminUsersView.vue**: 
   - Fixed issue with item.raw.role conditional access that was causing errors
   - Added null/undefined checks in template expressions

2. **AdminErrorBoundary.vue**: 
   - Fixed toast import and usage
   - Improved error capture and handling logic

3. **AdminBooksView.vue & AdminAuthorsView.vue**:
   - Fixed form validation approach for Options API
   - Added error handling for API operations

4. **AdminSettingsView.vue**:
   - Corrected toast notification usage pattern

### Common Conversion Patterns

When converting from Composition API to Options API:

1. Replace `setup()` with separate `data()`, `computed`, and `methods` options
2. Replace `ref()` and `reactive()` with properties in the `data()` function
3. Replace `computed()` functions with properties in the `computed` option
4. Move methods from within `setup()` to the `methods` option
5. Replace `onMounted()` with the `mounted()` lifecycle hook
6. Access component data/methods with `this.` prefix instead of direct variable access
7. Access stores within methods/computed instead of at the setup level
8. Component refs should be accessed with `this.$refs`

## Benefits of This Conversion

- **Consistency**: All admin panel components now use the same API approach
- **Maintainability**: Easier maintenance with a unified coding pattern
- **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns with the Options API organization
- **Readability**: Improved code structure for developers familiar with Options API
- **Reliability**: Fixed several bugs during the conversion process
- **Template Stability**: Added null checks to prevent template rendering errors

## Status: COMPLETE

All admin panel components have been successfully converted from Composition API to Options API. This includes:

- All view components (7 total)
- All layout components (1 total)
- All reusable components (2 total)
- Total of 10 components converted

## Next Steps

- Comprehensive testing of all admin panel components
- Consider converting remaining application components to Options API if consistency is desired
- Document the Options API pattern for future developers working on the project
