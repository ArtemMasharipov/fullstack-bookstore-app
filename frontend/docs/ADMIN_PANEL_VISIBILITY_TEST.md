1. For development testing, authentication has been temporarily bypassed for admin routes. 
2. Test both the desktop and mobile layouts.
3. Verify that all sidebar navigation items correctly link to their respective views.
4. Test with both admin and non-admin users when authentication is re-enabled.

## Post-Implementation Verification

After completing all tests, ensure:

1. All admin routes correctly use the admin layout
2. Navigation between admin views preserves the layout
3. Non-admin users cannot access the admin panel (when auth is re-enabled)
4. Responsive design works correctly on all screen sizes
