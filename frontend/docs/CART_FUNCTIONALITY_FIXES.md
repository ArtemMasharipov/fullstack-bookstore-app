# Cart Functionality Fixes

## Issues Addressed
- Cart count not updating immediately after adding items to cart
- Toast notifications not appearing until navigating to the cart page
- Inconsistent toast display after cart operations

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Cart Count Updates
- Added explicit `fetchCart()` calls after each cart operation
- Implemented in:
  - BookCard.vue
  - BookDetails.vue
  - CartItem.vue
  - CartList.vue

### 2. Toast Notifications
- Created `toastSync.js` utility for reliable notifications
- Implemented synchronized toast methods:
  - `syncSuccess()`
  - `syncError()`
  - `syncInfo()`
- Replaced all direct toast calls with synchronized versions
- Added delay mechanism to ensure toasts appear even during navigation

### 3. Navigation Bar Cart Badge
- Added periodic refresh for cart badge in NavBar
- Added visibility state checking to optimize updates
- Added event listener for authentication state changes
- Set up polling with appropriate intervals

### 4. CartItem Component Improvements
- Updated to use standardized Pinia access pattern
- Fixed removal and quantity update operations
- Ensured cart counter updates after each operation

## Code Changes

### Created New Files
- `src/utils/toastSync.js` - For synchronizing toast notifications

### Updated Files
- `src/components/cart/CartItem.vue`
- `src/components/cart/CartList.vue`
- `src/components/books/BookCard.vue`
- `src/components/books/BookDetails.vue`
- `src/components/layout/NavBar.vue`
- `src/stores/cart.js`
- `src/utils/index.js`

## Benefits
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users see toast notifications immediately after operations
- **Consistent UI**: Cart count badge always reflects the actual cart state
- **Better UX**: No need to navigate to cart to see operation results
- **Reliability**: Toast notifications work reliably across navigation events
- **Performance**: Optimized cart updates based on visibility state

## Testing Notes
All cart operations should be tested across different scenarios:
- Adding items from different pages
- Removing items from cart
- Updating quantities
- Clearing the cart
- Navigating between pages after operations
