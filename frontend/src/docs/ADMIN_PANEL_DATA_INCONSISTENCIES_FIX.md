# Summary of Fixes for Data Inconsistencies in Admin Panel

## Problems Addressed
1. Books showing prices as $0.00 when they should have actual values
2. Books showing "OUT OF STOCK" when they are marked as "inStock: true" in the database

## Root Causes

1. **Type Consistency Issues**:
   - The application was not consistently handling data type conversions
   - Boolean values weren't being strictly checked (`inStock === true`)
   - Price values needed proper numeric conversion

2. **Template Access Issues**:
   - Vuetify v-data-table-server wraps items in a `raw` property
   - Templates were trying to access properties directly instead of through `item.raw`

## Key Changes Made

1. **Fixed Normalization Functions**:
   - Added strict type handling in the store's `normalizeBooks` method
   - Used explicit equality checks for booleans (`inStock === true`) 
   - Added proper number conversion for prices
   - Fixed edge cases like NaN and Infinity values

2. **Enhanced Template Rendering**:
   - Updated templates to properly access values through `item.raw`
   - Added defensive checks to prevent errors with undefined values
   - Enhanced error handling and default values

3. **Added Debugging Tools**:
   - Created DebugApiResponse.vue component to inspect API responses
   - Added extensive logging for tracking data types and values
   - Made essential checks more strict and explicit

## Technical Notes

1. **Boolean Handling**:
   - Only consider a value as `true` if it's exactly the boolean value `true`
   - This ensures consistency regardless of the data source

2. **Number Handling**:
   - Force explicit conversion to numbers for all price values
   - Handle string-to-number conversion with proper validation
   - Ensure prices are never NaN or invalid

3. **Data Access Pattern**:
   - When using Vuetify v-data-table-server, always access row data via `item.raw` 
   - This is a key requirement for the component to work correctly

## Future Recommendations

1. **Consistent Type Handling**:
   - Create a shared utility for type normalization across the application
   - Use TypeScript to enforce stronger typing at development time

2. **API Response Standardization**:
   - Consider standardizing API responses to always return consistent data types
   - Apply normalization at the API service level before data reaches components

3. **Validation**:
   - Add runtime validation to catch type issues early
   - Consider schema validation for API responses
