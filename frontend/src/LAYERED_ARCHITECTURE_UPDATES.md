# Layered Architecture Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Import Path Updates**: 
   - Updated all import paths from `@/stores` to `@/store` to match the new layered architecture
   - Fixed imports in Vue components, store modules, and documentation files
   - Created and ran scripts to automate this process: `fix_imports.sh` and `update_docs_imports.sh`

2. **UI Component Import Path Updates**:
   - Fixed references to UI components that were moved from `components/common/` to `components/ui/`
   - Updated import paths in:
     - `CartList.vue` and `CartItem.vue`
     - `AuthorList.vue` and `AuthorForm.vue`
     - `BookForm.vue` and `BookList.vue`

3. **State Helpers Migration**:
   - Updated the `handleAsyncAction` function in both `utils/stateHelpers.js` and `store/modules/utils/stateHelpers.js`
   - Changed the function to work with Pinia's direct mutation approach instead of Vuex's commit pattern
   - The function now expects a store instance as first parameter instead of a commit function
   - Fixed a critical issue in the `finally` block where `commit` was still being used instead of the store method call

## Benefits

1. **Improved Architecture**: Code is now organized according to proper layered architecture principles
2. **Better Maintainability**: Related files are grouped together, making them easier to find and modify
3. **Fixed Runtime Errors**: Resolved issues with missing imports and incorrect function calls

## Documentation

New documentation has been created to explain the changes:
- `LAYERED_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md`: Overview of the layered architecture implementation
- `LAYERED_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`: Best practices for working with the new structure
- `IMPORT_PATHS_MIGRATION.md`: Guide for updating import paths
- `STATEHELPERS_MIGRATION.md`: Explanation of the state helpers changes for Pinia
