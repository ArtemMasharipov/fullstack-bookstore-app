## Development Guidelines

### Pinia Store Usage
Please follow our [Pinia Usage Guidelines](./docs/PINIA_USAGE_GUIDELINES.md) when working with stores. We've standardized our approach to using Pinia with Vue 3 Options API to ensure consistency across the project. For a summary of the refactoring work, see [Pinia Refactoring Summary](./docs/PINIA_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md).

### Cart Functionality
We've recently improved the cart functionality to ensure badge counts update immediately and toast notifications appear reliably. See [Cart Functionality Fixes](./docs/CART_FUNCTIONALITY_FIXES.md) for details and [Cart Functionality Test Plan](./docs/CART_FUNCTIONALITY_TEST_PLAN.md) for testing these features.

### Technical Documentation
